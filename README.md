# Creative Audio Programming (workshop)

## Introduction

This workshop consists of two practical sessions designed to learn how to code by creating audiovisual and interactive pieces suitable for the web. We will learn how to creatively code with P5.js and in particular we will explore the P5.sound library and other libraries related to sound and interaction. The workshop is oriented toward the challenge of creating an unusual interactive musical instrument / interface. The final projects will have the opportunity to be exhibited online.

This course is open to all students with interest in coding audio and visuals. This workshop is designed as a follow-up of an introductory workshop on generating visuals with P5.js.
